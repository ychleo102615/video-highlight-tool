## Validation Results (Updated)

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details leak: The spec correctly focuses on WHAT (interfaces like ITranscriptGenerator, IFileStorage, IVideoRepository) rather than HOW (specific frameworks or libraries). Even though it mentions Map<string, Video> and URL.createObjectURL(), these are described as requirements for the infrastructure implementations, not as technical decisions for other layers.

✅ **PASS** - Focused on business value: Each user story clearly explains the value proposition (e.g., "這是整個系統的核心資料來源" for Mock AI Service).

✅ **PASS** - Accessible to stakeholders: Written in Traditional Chinese with clear explanations, uses business terminology alongside technical concepts.

✅ **PASS** - Mandatory sections complete: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No clarification markers: The spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All decisions have been made with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **PASS** - Testable requirements: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-020) is specific and verifiable. For example, "FR-003: MockAIService MUST 模擬 1.5 秒的處理延遲" can be objectively tested.

✅ **PASS** - Measurable success criteria: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "2 秒內" and "至少 5 個段落和 15 個句子"
  - SC-002: "少於 10 毫秒"
  - SC-004: "測試覆蓋率達到 90% 以上"

✅ **PASS** - Technology-agnostic criteria: Success criteria focus on outcomes (response time, data completeness, resource management) rather than implementation details.

✅ **PASS** - Complete acceptance scenarios: Each user story includes 3 specific Given-When-Then scenarios that cover normal flow, variations, and edge cases.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified: 6 distinct edge cases are documented, covering data availability, query failures, duplicate operations, state loss, resource management, and user experience.

✅ **PASS** - Clear scope boundaries: The "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 9 items that are NOT included (real AI API, cloud storage, persistent storage, etc.).

✅ **PASS** - Assumptions documented: 8 clear assumptions are listed, including data structure locations, storage choices, timing decisions, and architectural constraints.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Requirements linked to acceptance criteria: Each functional requirement group (Mock AI Service, File Storage Service, Repositories) has corresponding acceptance scenarios in the user stories.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover all flows: The 5 prioritized user stories (P1, P1, P2, P2, P3) cover the complete infrastructure layer from data generation to persistence.

✅ **PASS** - Measurable outcomes defined: The 7 success criteria provide clear validation points for feature completion.

✅ **PASS** - No implementation leakage: While the spec mentions specific interfaces (ITranscriptGenerator, IFileStorage) and technologies (Map, URL.createObjectURL), these are correctly scoped as requirements for the infrastructure layer implementations, not decisions that violate Clean Architecture principles.

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully after adding persistence requirements. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Notable Strengths**:
1. Well-structured prioritization (P1 for core data sources, P2 for persistence and repositories, P3 for advanced features)
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage (11 scenarios including persistence failures, storage quotas, and cross-tab behavior)
3. Clear separation between in-scope (IndexedDB + SessionStorage for refresh recovery) and out-of-scope (long-term storage, cross-tab sync)
4. Bilingual approach makes it accessible to both technical and non-technical Chinese-speaking stakeholders
5. Each user story includes "Independent Test" section, making it clear how to validate functionality in isolation
6. Persistence strategy is pragmatic: 50MB threshold balances user experience with implementation complexity

**Changes in Update (2025-10-30 - Revision 2)**:
- Added User Story 6: Basic Persistence for Accidental Refresh (Priority P2)
- Added FR-021 to FR-027: BrowserStorage (internal helper) requirements
- **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CORRECTION**: Replaced `IPersistenceService` interface with `BrowserStorage` internal tool class
  - Reason: Infrastructure Layer should NOT define new interfaces (violates Clean Architecture principles)
  - BrowserStorage is an internal helper, not an Output Port interface
  - Only Repository uses BrowserStorage (through constructor injection)
  - This preserves 002-application-layer spec integrity (no need to modify it)
- Added SC-008 and SC-009: Measurable persistence outcomes
- Updated Assumptions: Clarified that BrowserStorage is internal, not an interface; Infrastructure Layer only implements existing interfaces
- Updated Edge Cases: Added 5 new edge cases for persistence scenarios
- Updated Key Entities: Added BrowserStorage (tool class) instead of IPersistenceService (interface)
- Updated Out of Scope: Clarified that long-term storage and cross-tab sync are excluded

**Implementation Approach**:
- Repository handles in-memory Map + delegates to BrowserStorage for persistence
- BrowserStorage is injected into Repository via constructor (concrete class, not interface)
- Small videos (≤ 50MB): Full file recovery via IndexedDB
- Large videos (> 50MB): No file storage, Repository returns null on restore
- Graceful degradation: If IndexedDB fails, BrowserStorage warns and continues (non-blocking)
- Automatic cleanup: BrowserStorage checks sessionId on init(), cleans stale data from closed tabs

**Architecture Compliance**:
- ✅ Infrastructure Layer does NOT define new interfaces
- ✅ Only implements interfaces from Domain Layer (IVideoRepository) and Application Layer (ITranscriptGenerator, IFileStorage)
- ✅ BrowserStorage is an internal implementation detail, not exposed as port
- ✅ No changes needed to 002-application-layer spec

**Minor Observations**:
- FR-003, FR-008, FR-009, FR-021 mention specific technologies (setTimeout, URL.createObjectURL, IndexedDB) which are acceptable for Infrastructure Layer specs as they define technical implementation requirements.
- Success criteria reference specific tools (Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler) for validation clarity.
- The 50MB threshold is documented as an assumption (adjustable based on testing)
