- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No implementation details leak: The spec correctly focuses on WHAT (interfaces like ITranscriptGenerator, IFileStorage, IVideoRepository) rather than HOW (specific frameworks or libraries). Even though it mentions Map<string, Video> and URL.createObjectURL(), these are described as requirements for the infrastructure implementations, not as technical decisions for other layers.

✅ **PASS** - Focused on business value: Each user story clearly explains the value proposition (e.g., "這是整個系統的核心資料來源" for Mock AI Service).

✅ **PASS** - Accessible to stakeholders: Written in Traditional Chinese with clear explanations, uses business terminology alongside technical concepts.

✅ **PASS** - Mandatory sections complete: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - No clarification markers: The spec contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All decisions have been made with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **PASS** - Testable requirements: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-020) is specific and verifiable. For example, "FR-003: MockAIService MUST 模擬 1.5 秒的處理延遲" can be objectively tested.

✅ **PASS** - Measurable success criteria: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: "2 秒內" and "至少 5 個段落和 15 個句子"
  - SC-002: "少於 10 毫秒"
  - SC-004: "測試覆蓋率達到 90% 以上"

✅ **PASS** - Technology-agnostic criteria: Success criteria focus on outcomes (response time, data completeness, resource management) rather than implementation details.

✅ **PASS** - Complete acceptance scenarios: Each user story includes 3 specific Given-When-Then scenarios that cover normal flow, variations, and edge cases.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases identified: 6 distinct edge cases are documented, covering data availability, query failures, duplicate operations, state loss, resource management, and user experience.

✅ **PASS** - Clear scope boundaries: The "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 9 items that are NOT included (real AI API, cloud storage, persistent storage, etc.).

✅ **PASS** - Assumptions documented: 8 clear assumptions are listed, including data structure locations, storage choices, timing decisions, and architectural constraints.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Requirements linked to acceptance criteria: Each functional requirement group (Mock AI Service, File Storage Service, Repositories) has corresponding acceptance scenarios in the user stories.

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover all flows: The 5 prioritized user stories (P1, P1, P2, P2, P3) cover the complete infrastructure layer from data generation to persistence.

✅ **PASS** - Measurable outcomes defined: The 7 success criteria provide clear validation points for feature completion.

✅ **PASS** - No implementation leakage: While the spec mentions specific interfaces (ITranscriptGenerator, IFileStorage) and technologies (Map, URL.createObjectURL), these are correctly scoped as requirements for the infrastructure layer implementations, not decisions that violate Clean Architecture principles.

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Notable Strengths**:
1. Well-structured prioritization (P1 for core data sources, P2 for persistence, P3 for advanced features)
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage (6 scenarios including resource management and UX considerations)
3. Clear separation between in-scope (mock implementations, memory storage) and out-of-scope (real APIs, cloud storage)
4. Bilingual approach makes it accessible to both technical and non-technical Chinese-speaking stakeholders
5. Each user story includes "Independent Test" section, making it clear how to validate functionality in isolation

**Minor Observations**:
- FR-003, FR-008, FR-009 mention specific implementation approaches (setTimeout, URL.createObjectURL) which could be considered implementation details. However, in the context of an Infrastructure Layer spec, these are acceptable as they define the contract that this layer must fulfill.
- Success criteria reference specific tools (Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler) which is good for validation clarity.
