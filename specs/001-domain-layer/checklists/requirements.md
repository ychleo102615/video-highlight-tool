## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review

✅ **Pass** - The specification focuses on domain entities and value objects without mentioning specific frameworks or implementation details. It's written from the perspective of defining business requirements for the domain layer.

✅ **Pass** - The spec focuses on business needs: managing video entities, transcript aggregates, highlight selections, and time value objects. All content is structured around user stories for development teams.

✅ **Pass** - User stories are written in plain language describing what needs to be built and why, with clear acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format.

✅ **Pass** - All mandatory sections are present and completed: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (Functional Requirements, Key Entities), Success Criteria, plus additional sections (Assumptions, Constraints, Out of Scope, Dependencies, Related Features, Notes).

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **Pass** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification.

✅ **Pass** - All functional requirements are specific and testable:
- FR-001 to FR-004: Video entity requirements with clear attributes and methods
- FR-005 to FR-013: Transcript aggregate requirements with specific query methods
- FR-014 to FR-023: Highlight aggregate requirements with detailed selection management methods
- FR-024 to FR-032: Value object requirements with validation rules
- FR-033 to FR-036: Repository interface requirements with method signatures

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: Entity instantiation verification
- SC-002: Validation rule effectiveness
- SC-003: Query performance O(n)
- SC-004: Selection operation performance O(1)
- SC-005: Cross-aggregate query accuracy
- SC-006: Repository interface completeness
- SC-007: No external dependencies
- SC-008: 90% test coverage target
- SC-009: 100% TypeScript type coverage
- SC-010: Clean Architecture & DDD compliance

✅ **Pass** - Success criteria focus on outcomes rather than implementation:
- No mention of specific frameworks or tools
- Focus on performance characteristics (O(n), O(1))
- Emphasis on architectural principles
- Measurable quality metrics (coverage percentages)

✅ **Pass** - All five user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios:
- User Story 1: 4 acceptance scenarios for Video entity
- User Story 2: 5 acceptance scenarios for Transcript aggregate
- User Story 3: 7 acceptance scenarios for Highlight aggregate
- User Story 4: 8 acceptance scenarios for Time value objects
- User Story 5: 4 acceptance scenarios for Repository interfaces

✅ **Pass** - Edge cases section covers 7 scenarios:
- Video entity - missing URL
- Transcript query - nonexistent ID
- Highlight selection - duplicate addition
- Highlight selection - empty selection
- Time value object - boundary values
- Time range - same time
- Cross-aggregate query - nonexistent transcript

✅ **Pass** - Scope clearly defined:
- In scope: Domain layer entities, value objects, repository interfaces
- Out of scope: 10 items clearly listed (repository implementations, use cases, UI components, API services, state management, video playback logic, data persistence, error handling strategy, performance optimization, i18n)

✅ **Pass** - Dependencies section lists 5 items:
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Vite project environment
- Vitest testing framework
- TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md reference
- REQUIREMENTS.md Phase 2 reference

Assumptions section lists 10 detailed assumptions covering time format, ID generation, File type, readonly implementation, query performance, cross-aggregate references, duplicate selection handling, sorting logic, validation error handling, and repository async patterns.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Pass** - All 36 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-036) have corresponding acceptance scenarios in the user stories that validate them.

✅ **Pass** - Five prioritized user stories cover all primary flows:
- P1: Video entity management (foundation)
- P1: Transcript aggregate & sentence management (core data)
- P1: Highlight selection management (core user operation)
- P2: Time value objects (supporting infrastructure)
- P2: Repository interface definition (preparation for next layer)

✅ **Pass** - The 10 success criteria (SC-001 to SC-010) provide comprehensive measurable outcomes covering entity instantiation, validation, performance, cross-aggregate coordination, repository interface quality, architectural compliance, and code quality metrics.

✅ **Pass** - The specification maintains focus on "what" needs to be built rather than "how". While it mentions TypeScript types and method signatures in requirements, this is appropriate for defining domain entity contracts. No framework-specific implementation details are present.

## Summary

✅ **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`). The Domain Layer specification successfully:

1. Defines all required domain entities (Video, Transcript, Section, Sentence, Highlight) with clear responsibilities
2. Specifies value objects (TimeStamp, TimeRange, VideoMetadata) with validation rules
3. Outlines repository interfaces following DDD principles
4. Provides comprehensive acceptance scenarios for all user stories
5. Establishes measurable success criteria
6. Documents assumptions, constraints, and scope boundaries
7. Maintains technology-agnostic language while providing sufficient detail for implementation

The specification adheres to Clean Architecture and DDD principles, ensuring the domain layer remains pure and independent of external concerns.
