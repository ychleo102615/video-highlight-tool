# Specification Quality Checklist: Application Layer Development

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

**Validation Results**:

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: The specification focuses on the what and why of Application Layer development, describing use cases, ports, and DTOs without mentioning specific implementation technologies (beyond the necessary TypeScript types).

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 23 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-023) are clearly defined and testable
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific
   - Success criteria (SC-001 to SC-006) are measurable and technology-agnostic
   - 5 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios covering the full workflow
   - Edge cases identified for error handling, data consistency, and concurrent operations

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each user story includes independent test descriptions and priority levels
   - Scope is clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies on Domain Layer clearly stated
   - Assumptions documented for implementation guidance

## Notes

- The specification is ready for the next phase: `/speckit.plan`
- All use cases follow Clean Architecture principles with clear dependency direction
- Port interfaces (ITranscriptGenerator, IFileStorage) provide clear contracts for Infrastructure Layer implementation
